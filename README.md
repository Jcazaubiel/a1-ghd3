**What I Created**

I wanted to do something interactive, like a little story. I chose to base it on the Legend of Zelda videogames, since I really like them. When we load the page first, we start with a starting view: A quick introduction, the triforce missing, Link and Zelda in front of each other, and a book at the bottom with an instruction to hit it.

Once the user clicks on the book, the instruction to hit it disappears, and a few things happen. A path to the correct pillar to hit appears, along with text saying to hit the pillar. The pillar also changes color, and goes from yellow to blue to further separate it from the others.

Finally, once the user clicks on the correct pillar, the text saying to hit hit disappears. A triforce also appears a little more slowly on top of all the pillars, and a final piece of text appears to let the player know they got the Triforce.
